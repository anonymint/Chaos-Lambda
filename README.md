# Chaos-Lambda
From Simian Army to Lambda serverless 

This is an attempt to port [SimianArmy](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy) to serverless model with AWS Lambda inspired from [Chaos Lambda](https://github.com/bbc/chaos-lambda)

I modified some of the code and use Terraform to script out all related infrastructure.
